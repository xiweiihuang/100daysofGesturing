# 100daysofGesturing
100days dedicate to represent subtle gestures

This is an ongoing animation project that explores the use of human body language. Aiming to represent how body and hand gestures can be universally understood while being abstract compare to the precise verbal communication.

Oftentimes body languages are subtle and subconscious, thus conveys implicit messages than express necessarily indirect emotions. 

Every i will animate a gesture that I found while observing people around
me on their daily reaction and recreate it in loop on a well-rigged terminator 
model using Cinema 4D.
